					About
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					The Employment and Life Skills Academic Competition has been developed by John Fox and Michael Signorotti. John Fox is an educator at American Legion High School. Michael Signorotti is an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley and a graduate of Christian Brothers High School. Michael is the original and current sponsor of the Employment and Life Skills Academic Competition.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Michael was nominated by The First Tee to attend the 2009 Young Leaders Conference at Pebble Beach Golf Links. He was awarded a $1,000 Young Leaders Partnership Grant sponsored by	the Walmart and Unilever corporations. Michael was given the opportunity to design his own	community involvement responsibility initiative. After reviewing his options, Michael decided to design and manage an academic competition focusing on career and technical preparation as well as financial literacy. The first annual Academic Competition took place at American Legion High School in 2010.

					Objective
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					The Academic Competition is a program that teaches teenagers r&eacute;sum&eacute;  writing, job interview and	oral presentation skills, and financial literacy. The objective of the Academic Competition is to prepare high school students for life after graduation by not only making them competitive for the workforce but also teaching them information about managing their finances.

				<h2>
					Curriculum
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					The student participants prepare for the Academic Competition, which includes other area high	schools, through an enriching afterschool program. A resource guide is distributed 
					to all student participants. The resource guide serves as an outline of the various skills and financial concepts to be mastered as an Academic Competition participant.
					The competition includes four categories in which students will be evaluated as individuals or part of their high school team. These categories are their oral presentation, a mock job interview, a	written essay focusing on financial literacy, and an objective section where the high school teams compete to answer financial-based questions in a game-show format.
