					The Career Readiness and Financial Literacy Competition is a program that teaches teenagers r&eacute;sum&eacute;  writing, job interview and oral presentation skills, and financial literacy. The objective of the Competition is to prepare high school students for life after graduation by not only making them competitive for the workforce but also teaching them information about managing their finances.

				<h2>
					Curriculum
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					Students from multiple area high schools prepare for the Career Readiness and Financial Literacy Competition through an enriching afterschool program. A resource guide is distributed to all student participants and serves as an outline of the various skills and financial concepts to be mastered by the end of the program. Students are evaluated as individuals or part of their high school teams in four categories: an oral presentation, a mock job interview, a	written essay focusing on financial literacy, and a game show in which high school teams compete to answer financial-based questions.
