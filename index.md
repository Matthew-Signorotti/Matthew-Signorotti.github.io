# My course notes

For some classes I have taken at UC Berkeley, I have typed (sometimes extensive) notes documents. Please enjoy perusing my work â€” hopefully you will find some of it educational!

| Class | Topic | Comment |
|:------|:------|:--------|
| [Math 54](course_notes/Math_54.pdf) | Linear algebra | These notes are my most extensive. |
